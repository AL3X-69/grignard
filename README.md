# Grignard
Grignard is a javascript / typescript library focused on parsing and rendering chemical molecules and entities.
With it, you can parse or create a molecule inside your code and get a cool svg or png of its chemical schematic.
The library is focused on speed, stability and is made to work on the DOM.

**The library is not finished, not published on npm and I'm still working on it. But any help is greatly appreciated.**
Don't hesitate to open an issue, to report a bug, ask a question or just suggest something, I'll be happy to respond and discuss with you!

## Features
**WIP**

The final goal is to have a nice chemical drawing library that works for my websites.

Born the 6th of May 1871, Victor Grignard is a French chemist, who won a Nobel Prize of Chemistry in 1912 for his works on the "Grignard reactives", an important discovery who led to importants breakthroughs in organic chemistry. 

He later became the dean of the Sciences Faculty of Lyon in France (this university became the "Universit√© Claude Bernard Lyon 1", where I study Electronics and Medicine) in 1929. 

He died the 13th of december 1935.

You can find more information about him on his [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Grignard) or about his [nobel prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1912/summary/). 

If you are more into details and are interested in his works, I found some scan of his books on internet :
- [His thesis about "mixed organomagnesium compounds"](https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k9631198g)
